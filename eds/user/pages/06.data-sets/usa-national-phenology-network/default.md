Phenology is the study of how plants and animals change in response to seasonal changes.

Think tree leaf out in the Spring and leaves turning color in the Fall. The National Phenology Network monitors the impact of climate change on plants and animals by observing changes in their seasonal responses. NPN uses various data sources from satellite data to direct observation and citizen science.
