# eBird – North American Birds Data

[eBird – North American Birds Data](http://ebird.org/ebird/explore)

eBird data presents species representations and distribution as well as a host of other wild bird data. For you birders out there this is a great resource.

===

The data are gathered largely through citizen science efforts as individuals record sitings of species and submit them to the eBird site.

In addition, these data, combined with other data such as NASA remotely sensed data are used to model bird distributions through time and to produce the annual State of North America’s Birds report, developed with the Cornell Ornithology Lab. http://ebird.org/content/ebird/news/sonab2016/
