# Cloned Plant Phenology for Climatalogical Research

[Cloned Plant Phenology for Climatalogical Research](http://budburst.org/science-whatsnew_lilacphenology)

Beginning in the 1950s, the USDA, began to collect phenology data from selected plant species to help assess seasonal weather patterns and predict crop yields. Several plant species have been used during the program.

===

Of particular interest is the use of cloned plants as part of this investigation. Using genetically identical plants, distributed geographically allows the research to control in part for variation in species due to geography. The link above provides a short history of this project. More information about lilac data can be found here: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/phenology/north_america_lilac.txt, and the National Phenology Network contains a more comprehensive listing of these types of phenological data. https://www.usanpn.org/results/dataset-list?keys=lilac
