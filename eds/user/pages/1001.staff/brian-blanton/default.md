RENCI’s director of environmental initiatives and a coastal oceanographer with 15+ years of experience in coastal hazards and risk assessment, high performance computing, and earth sciences data analysis. He co-leads the Environmental Sciences group with Ray Idaszak, building connections between water-themed sciences and applications through sustainable software development and data management practices. His research usually involves applications of the storm-surge and wind-wave model ADCIRC, for problems such as how the Federal Emergency Management Agency computes coastal floodplain statistics, rapid statistical forecasting of storm surge, and risk-based coastal evacuation routing. He is also leading RENCI’s efforts in bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications through NSF’s Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers program. He earned a PhD (2003) in Marine Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a BS (1991) in mathematics from Armstrong State College in Savannah, Georgia.

**Project:** A multi-tiered ADCIRC-based storm surge and wave prediction system

**Other Research Participants/Partners:** Rick Luettich, Chris Calloway and Crystal Fulcher,UNC-Chapel Hill; Jason Fleming, Seahorse Coastal Consulting

**Project Description:** Decision-makers need critical and helpful information delivered on time and in formats that are easily understandable. This is particularly true with dangerous and destructive natural hazards such as hurricanes and the resulting wind, storm surge, and wave impacts. Late and/or incomprehensible information is useless. This DHS CRC project is about reducing the time needed to deliver hazard information to end users by using advanced models for storm surge, very high performance computing resources, and statistical methods that can provide early guidance information in a matter of minutes as opposed to hours.

**Research Interests:** Sea-level rise and coastal flood hazards; application of high-performance computing to tide, storm surge, and wind wave modeling
